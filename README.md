# onthisday-example
A self-contained HTML/CSS/Javascript example of how the Wikipedia "[OnThisDay](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/#!/Feed/aggregatedFeed_0)" endpoint could be used.

This was super quick-and-dirty and slapped together, so please forgive issues/bugs as it's just meant as an example.
